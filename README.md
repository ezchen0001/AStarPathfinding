# AStarPathfinding

By Ethan Chen

This project is an implementation of the AStar algorithm to create a pathfinding ai, created for IMGD 4000 (D25)

When played, the game randomly generates a grid of cube obstacles and one ai actor.

The ai actor will pick a random empty space on the grid to move towards, and once it reaches the goal, it stops briefly before picking a new goal.
